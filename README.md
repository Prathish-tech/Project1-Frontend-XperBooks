Installation
Prerequisites

Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
npm (v6.0.0 or later)
Backend API server (separate repository/setup)

Setup

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/xperbooks-frontend.git
cd xperbooks-frontend

Install dependencies:
bashnpm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

Start the development server:
bashnpm start

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Configuration
The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend API running on localhost:8000 by default. This can be changed in the .env file:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://your-api-url
Usage
Adding a Book

Navigate to the 'Add Book' page
Fill in the required fields (Title, Author, Publisher, etc.)
Click 'Add Book' to submit the form
Upon successful addition, you will be redirected to the books list

Viewing Books

The home page displays all books in a responsive grid/list
Click on a book to view its details
Use the search bar to find specific books
Apply filters to narrow down the results

Editing Books

Navigate to a specific book's details page
Click the 'Edit' button
Modify the desired fields
Click 'Save Changes' to update the book information

Deleting Books

On the book details page or in the books list
Click the 'Delete' button
Confirm the deletion in the prompt
The book will be removed from the collection

API Integration
The frontend communicates with the Django REST API using the following endpoints:

GET /books/ - Retrieve all books
GET /books/:id/ - Retrieve a specific book
POST /books/ - Add a new book
PUT /books/:id/ - Update an existing book
DELETE /books/:id/ - Delete a book

All API requests are handled in the services/api.js file.
